# skills

**A complete, opinionated software development workflow suite for Claude Code — 27 skills covering the full lifecycle, two auto-loading principle packs, three foundational primers (thinking, design, lateral), a model-selection framework, a three-scale research family, and cross-project knowledge patterns.**

Use this when you want agents that ship real projects: ideation → research → architecture → roadmap → per-phase build, with doc-review, refactor, security, and release baked in. Every step is a skill. Every skill is opinionated about what it produces. Every doc is indexed so future sessions never start blind.

Full methodology: [`docs/build-process.md`](docs/build-process.md)

                    Run once per new project, before /ideate.

/ideate           → Define the project. North star (vision, principles, domain model).
                    Identify domains that need research.
                    Auto-calls /scout for prior art discovery.

/scout            → Breadth-first prior art discovery. Adjacent projects, approaches,
                    patterns, lessons. Produces landscape brief + research recommendations.

## What's Special

### 1. The knowledge index ties everything together

Every project has a two-layer knowledge index, fully **derived from frontmatter**:

- `docs/knowledge-index.yaml` (terse, ~5KB) — auto-loaded at session start. Title, type, kind, `consumer_hint` ("when do I read this?") for every doc.
- `docs/knowledge-index-detail.yaml` (rich, ~25KB) — on-demand. `summary`, `decisions:`/`key_findings:`, `supersession_note:`, `related[]` cross-references.

**Sibling skills don't write to the index.** They emit conformant frontmatter on the docs they produce and call `/knowledge-index`, which regenerates both layers from frontmatter and runs an inline lint pass. This kills append-drift entirely — the index can't go stale relative to source.

**Frontmatter convention (v2, redesigned 2026-05-03):**
- `description:` — "when do I read this?" hook (becomes `consumer_hint` in terse layer)
- `type:` — north-star | architecture | roadmap | brief | program-parent | program-report | design | features | ideate | workon | module-rules | …
- `kind:` — `planning` | `research` | `historical` (usually derived from `type:` + `status:`)
- `summary:` — 1-2 sentences on what's in the doc
- `decisions:` — required for `kind: planning` (5-9 highest-leverage commitments)
- `key_findings:` — required for `kind: research` (3-7 bullets); both fields allowed on syntheses that bottom-line a recommendation
- `supersession_note:` — optional, for partially-stale docs
- `research_method:` — auto-stamped by `/brief`, `/research`, `/deep-research`, `/research-program`

**Lint mode is controlled by `schema_version` in the index header:** `1` = grace mode (warnings only — for projects mid-migration), `2` = enforce mode (errors block regeneration). New projects scaffolded by `/init-project` start at `2`.

The lint pass catches: missing required fields, broken `superseded_by:` and `related[]` chains, `kind:` ↔ derivation disagreements, stale `updated:` vs git mtime, unrecognized `status:` values, `decisions:` cap violations.

See [`knowledge-index/SKILL.md`](knowledge-index/SKILL.md) for the full spec, [`knowledge-index/REDESIGN-SKETCH.md`](knowledge-index/REDESIGN-SKETCH.md) for design rationale, and [`docs/build-process.md`](docs/build-process.md) for how the index threads through every skill.

### 2. First-principles thinking layer

Thinking-heavy skills load a concrete thinking primer before starting: 10 moves organized as **Open → Challenge → Synthesize → Verify**. Each skill declares which moves to emphasize.

Loaded by: `/research`, `/deep-research`, `/research-program`, `/ideate`, `/architecture`, `/brief`, `/roadmap`.

See [`docs/first-principles.md`](docs/first-principles.md).

### 3. Oblique strategies (lateral thinking)

When structured thinking gets stuck — circular ideation, local optima, over-constrained problems — oblique strategies provide lateral moves: 10 techniques across **Reframe → Constrain → Stimulate**. Inspired by Brian Eno, Edward de Bono, TRIZ, and design thinking.

The key: use lateral moves to FIND new directions, then switch back to first-principles to EVALUATE them. The two primers work as a pair.

Loaded by: `/ideate` (primary), `/architecture` (when options seem equal), `/expand` (when scope feels forced).

See [`docs/oblique-strategies.md`](docs/oblique-strategies.md).

### 4. System design layer

Design-heavy skills and design-sensitive refactor/expansion skills load a system design primer before starting: 15 moves organized across **Structure → Interfaces → Data → Scale → Reliability**. The unifying principle is "earn your complexity" — 12 moves are design-in (cheap now, expensive to retrofit), 3 are earn-in (add only with measured evidence). Each skill declares which moves to emphasize.

| Skill | Emphasis | Why |
|-------|----------|-----|
| `/architecture` | Structure + Interfaces | Highest-leverage decisions that cascade |
| `/design` | Interfaces + Data | Bridges architecture to implementation |
| `/implement` | Data + Scale + Reliability | Where design meets reality |
| `/brief` | All (when topic is system design) | Curate toward the decisions builders face |
| `/refactor-design` | Interfaces + Structure | Surfacing the abstractions that *should* exist |
| `/bold-refactor` | Structure | Collapsing premature boundaries, undoing irreversible decisions |
| `/feature` | Interfaces + Minimize Irreversible | Extend contracts additively, avoid premature lock-in |
| `/expand` | Structure + Contracts | Defining new boundaries and their contracts before building |

Loaded by: `/architecture`, `/design`, `/implement`, `/brief`, `/refactor-design`, `/bold-refactor`, `/feature`, `/expand`.

See [`docs/system-design.md`](docs/system-design.md).

### 5. Model-selection framework

Claude has two levers — **model** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) and **effort** (thinking budget). Used well, they save 3-5× cost with no quality loss. Used poorly, they waste money on easy tasks and shortchange hard ones.

The pattern doc defines four archetypes — every role inside every skill maps to one:

| Archetype | Model + Effort | Typical role |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| **Orchestration** | Opus high | Few calls, cascading consequences (`/architecture`, `/design`, `/deep-research` Lead, `/research-program` Planner) |
| **Parallel worker** | Sonnet medium | Many parallel, scoped (research sub-agents, deep-research specialists). At program scale, campaigns themselves are the workers — each a full Opus+Sonnet tree. |
| **Synthesis / judgment** | Opus high | One call, integrates N inputs (synthesis agents, `/brief`, cross-campaign synthesizers + evaluators) |
| **Volume / structured extraction** | Haiku low | Many calls, well-defined task (entity extraction, citation verification) |

Every SKILL.md that spawns sub-agents declares its archetype mapping in a **Model Assignment** section. See [`docs/model-selection-pattern.md`](docs/model-selection-pattern.md).

### 6. The Research Skills Family — three scales of the same fractal pattern

The research tools (`/research`, `/deep-research`, `/research-program`) are a single architectural pattern applied at three scales. Every scale has the same four roles: an **Orchestrator** that decomposes and dispatches, **Workers** that investigate in parallel with isolated contexts, a **Synthesizer** that reconciles their outputs, and an **Evaluator** that judges quality independently. What changes across scales is what each role orchestrates and how much is delegated.

| Scale | Skill | Orchestrator | Workers | Unit of output | Cost (calibrated) |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Question | `/research` | Researcher (Opus) | 3-5 Sonnet sub-agents | One domain brief + reference skill | ~$3-5 |
| Domain | `/deep-research` | Lead (Opus) | 5-7 Sonnet specialists | Campaign dir (parent + N briefs + quality report) | ~$6 scoped, ~$12-15 default |
| Megatopic | `/research-program` | Planner (Opus) | 3-7 Campaigns (full `/deep-research` runs) | Program dir (plan + super-parent + N campaigns + program evaluation) | ~$35-75 |

**Isolation is the load-bearing principle.** Workers never see each other's full output (only sibling titles). Synthesizer sees everything. Evaluator sees only the produced briefs + seed — not the orchestrator's reasoning, not the decomposition tree. This prevents framing-bias inheritance: the Evaluator judges *what was produced*, not *what was intended*. The same rule applies at every scale.

**Composition:** `/research` escalates to `/deep-research` when topic is broad; `/deep-research` escalates to `/research-program` when seed is megatopic. `/deep-research --continue-from` extends a leaf of a prior campaign via chain mode. All three share reuse checks — existing briefs and campaigns are cited rather than re-run.

**Demo-validated (2026-04-15/16):** 4 `/deep-research` campaigns (coverage 0.83-0.92, coherence 4.0-4.5/5) + 1 `/research-program` (5 campaigns, coverage 0.86, coherence 4.2/5). Key findings: severity reassessment happens in ~50% of campaigns; child synthesis mis-reports resolution status ~50% of the time in the direction of optimism (hence "Evaluator verifies, doesn't trust" as a core principle). **Known limitation:** nested agent spawning is blocked — `/research-program` campaign Leads run as single-agent research rather than the designed four-role tree. Quality is unaffected; parallelism benefits don't apply.

Grounded in Anthropic's multi-agent research pattern: 90% time reduction, 90.2% quality improvement over single-agent Opus on internal research eval.

See [`docs/research-skills-overview.md`](docs/research-skills-overview.md) (family view) · [`docs/deep-research-north-star.md`](docs/deep-research-north-star.md) + [`docs/deep-research-architecture.md`](docs/deep-research-architecture.md) · [`docs/research-program-architecture.md`](docs/research-program-architecture.md).

### 7. Cross-project knowledge patterns

Four pattern docs abstract the knowledge-layer design used by any project with a knowledge base (a cloud-native MCP server, a local simulation engine, whatever). Storage/retrieval/generation are three independent concerns; adopt them in any order.

| Pattern | What it covers |
|---------|---------------|
| [Overview](docs/knowledge-layer-overview.md) | The LLM Wiki pattern; three concerns; scale ladder |
| [Storage](docs/knowledge-storage-pattern.md) | Frontmatter schema, typed cross-references, knowledge graph, backends |
| [Retrieval](docs/knowledge-retrieval-pattern.md) | Tiered retrieval (L0-L3), metadata-first filtering, search ladder (v1-v3) |
| [Generation](docs/knowledge-generation-pattern.md) | Ingest, refresh, lint, LLM enrichment, provenance, lifecycle |

### 8. Quality gates, not ceremony

- **`/doc-review`** catches cross-doc drift with cascading passes (system-level → per-module). Triggered after `/architecture`, after `/roadmap`, at quality checkpoints, and when `/update-documentation` changes planning docs. **Auto-fix loop has a mandatory re-audit gate** — every iteration's exit gate REQUIRES a freshly-dispatched Sonnet Agent for the audit; orchestrator self-verification (grep, spot-check, intuition) is forbidden (added 2026-05-03). The exit decision is read mechanically from the dispatched verifier's structured severity counts.
- **Loop exit gates are external-verifier-only across all skills.** Any loop converging on a quality criterion (auto-fix, evaluator pass, gate verification) MUST delegate the exit decision to a separately-dispatched verifier in a fresh context. The orchestrator's self-confidence is not an exit gate. See [`docs/build-process.md`](docs/build-process.md) → "Loop Exit Gates: External Verifier Required" for the full rule and rationale.
- **`/security-review`** produces a scored report before deploy. Address Critical/High first.
- **Every phase ships tests.** Phase is done when its PR merges with CI green.
- **Infrastructure safety is non-negotiable.** `terraform apply` runs in CI only. Resources are prefixed. State is remote. `prevent_destroy` on critical resources. See [`docs/build-process.md#infrastructure-safety-practices`](docs/build-process.md).

## How to Use

1. **Start a new conversation.** Describe your idea or task.
2. **Run `/knowledge-index`** to see what context already exists for this project.
3. **Type the slash command** for the current step (e.g., `/ideate` for a new project).
4. **The skill guides you.** It asks questions, researches, produces docs.
5. **You decide when to advance.** Each skill has checkpoints. Say "this is solid" to move on, or "let's research more" to go deeper.
6. **Repeat** through the pipeline until the project ships.

## Key Rules

1. **Load the knowledge index first.** Every non-fresh session starts with `/knowledge-index`.
2. **Research before design.** Don't make architecture decisions based on assumptions.
3. **Each planning doc has one job.** North star = vision. Architecture = how. Roadmap = phases. No duplication.
4. **Every phase ships with tests.** A phase is done when its PR merges with CI green.
5. **Never `terraform apply` locally.** CI only, on merge to main.
6. **Never commit secrets.**
7. **Quality checkpoint every 2-4 phases.** Refactor + patterns + test gaps + doc-review.
8. **Security review before deploy.** No Critical/High findings.
9. **Every SKILL.md declares its Model Assignment.** Explicit model choice per role — don't default to Opus everywhere.
10. **Thinking-heavy skills load `first-principles.md` before starting.** Shallow thinking propagates downstream.
11. **Design-heavy skills load `system-design.md` before starting.** 15 moves across Structure, Interfaces, Data, Scale, Reliability. Earn your complexity.

## Installation

**Recommended — symlink the repo as your skills folder.** Zero drift, edits visible immediately:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewclark88/skills.git ~/dev/skills
ln -s ~/dev/skills ~/.claude/skills
```

Claude Code discovers every top-level directory with a `SKILL.md` and ignores `README.md`, `docs/`, and other siblings. Pull to update.

**Alternative — copy skills individually.** Use this if you don't want the whole repo under `~/.claude/skills`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andrewclark88/skills.git
cd skills
for d in */; do
  [ -f "$d/SKILL.md" ] && cp -r "$d" ~/.claude/skills/
done
```

The cross-cutting docs under `docs/` are referenced by absolute path from SKILL.md files (e.g., `/dev/skills/docs/first-principles.md`). Keep this repo checked out at a stable path so those references resolve.

## Design Philosophy

- **Opinionated over flexible.** Each skill has a single job and strong defaults. Less configuration, more convergence.
- **Ship through PRs.** Nothing merges without CI. Every phase done when the PR merges, not when it "works locally."
- **Deep knowledge over shallow retrieval.** Briefs are compiled knowledge, not chunked raw docs. The knowledge layer uses the LLM Wiki pattern.
- **Good results over token savings.** Defaults favor quality; fences exist but start generous. Model selection saves cost where quality isn't impacted, not where it is.
- **Data-driven over hand-curated.** When there's a data source, build a pipeline.
- **Explicit over implicit.** Every sub-agent dispatch names its model. Every doc has frontmatter. Every phase has acceptance criteria.

## Acknowledgments

A handful of the pipeline skills were originally inspired by the open suite from [nklisch/skills](https://github.com/nklisch/skills). This suite has evolved substantially since then — knowledge-index integration across all skills, the thinking layer, the model-selection framework, the three-scale research family (`/research`, `/deep-research`, `/research-program`), `/scout`, the cross-project knowledge patterns, cascading `/doc-review`, and the full infrastructure-safety methodology are first-party additions. To compare against upstream, clone fresh from the source repo and diff.
